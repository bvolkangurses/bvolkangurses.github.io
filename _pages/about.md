I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Physics at Caltech working broadly on integrated systems. I am especially interested in studying the fundamental physical limits of technologies by connecting their high-level realization to fundamental physics and building technologies that achieve these limits.

<b>Research</b>: My PhD research focused on developing large-scale integrated photonic-electronic systems for applications in communications, sensing and computing. I invented various technologies that employ quantum information to achieve superior performance over their classical counterparts. These include quantum phased arrays that generalize the operating principles of antenna arrays to quantum fields and coherent transceivers that utilize non-classical light to achieve higher sensitivity and channel capacity in optical links.

<b>Previously</b>: I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology, where I worked with Professors Hua Wang, Morris Cohen, Gregory Durgin and Lukas Graber. I was an awardee of the R. David Middlebrook Fellowship, Tau Beta Pi Fellowship, IEEE MTT-S Undergraduate/Pre-Graduate Scholarship, European Union Contest for Young Scientists CERN Special Donated Prize and First Prize in Physics in the Turkish National Secondary School Research Contest.
