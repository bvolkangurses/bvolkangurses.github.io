I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Physics at Caltech working broadly on integrated systems. I am especially interested in studying the scaling laws in technologies, discovering their fundamental physical limits and pushing these limits by breaking assumptions.

<b>Research</b>: My PhD research focused on developing large-scale integrated photonic-electronic systems for applications in communications, sensing and computing. I invented various technologies that employ quantum information to achieve superior performance over classical technologies. These include quantum phased arrays, which generalize the operating principles of antenna arrays to quantum fields and quantum-enhanced coherent transceivers that utilize non-classical light to achieve higher sensitivity and channel capacity in links.

<b>Previously</b>: I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology, where I worked with Professors Hua Wang, Morris Cohen, Gregory Durgin and Lukas Graber.
