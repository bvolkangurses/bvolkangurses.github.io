I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Physics at Caltech working broadly on integrated systems. My goal is to build technologies that operates at the fundamental physical limits.

<b>Research</b>: My PhD research focused on developing large-scale integrated photonic-electronic systems for quantum information science and high-performance computing. I invented various technologies that leverage quantum information to achieve superior performance over their classical counterparts. One example is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09158">quantum phased arrays</a> that generalized antenna theory to quantized electromagnetic fields and demonstrated the first free-space interface for quantum information.

<b>Previously</b>: I received my Master of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from Caltech and Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from <a href="https://ece.gatech.edu/news/2023/12/gurses-receives-tau-beta-pi-fellowship">Georgia Tech</a>. I was an awardee of the R. David Middlebrook Fellowship, <a href="https://www.tbp.org/memb/FellowsList/2020-21.cfm">Tau Beta Pi Fellowship</a>, <a href="https://ece.gatech.edu/news/2023/12/gurses-tapped-ieee-mtt-s-scholarship">IEEE MTT-S Undergraduate/Pre-Graduate Scholarship</a>, <a href="https://home.cern/news/news/cern/eucys-prizewinner-visits-cern">European Union Contest for Young Scientists CERN Special Donated Prize</a> and <a href="https://www.milliyet.com.tr/yerel-haberler/ankara/yapay-yercekimi-tubitakta-odul-getirdi-10815786">First Prize in Physics in the Turkish National Secondary School Research Contest</a>.
