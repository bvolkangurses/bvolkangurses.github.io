I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Physics at Caltech. My goal is to build technologies that operate at the fundamental physical limits.

<b>Research</b>: My research focuses on studying the fundamental physical limits of technologies (e.g. Landauer, Bekenstein, Holevo limits) and developing technologies that operate at these limits. To that end, I invented various technologies that push current devices to these limits by leveraging concepts from fundamental physics. One example is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09158">quantum phased arrays</a> that demonstrated the first free-space sensor and transceiver that can operate at the Heisenberg limit (overcoming the standard quantum limit) and the first free-space interface for quantum information. I also invented quantum coherent transceivers that can operate at the Holevo limit (overcoming the Shannon limit) and put together a roadmap to couple these transceivers with efficient processors to push computing to the Landauer limit.

<b>Previously</b>: I received my Master of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from Caltech and Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from <a href="https://ece.gatech.edu">Georgia Tech</a>. I was an awardee of the Caltech Entrepreneurship Prize, Broadcom Innovation Fund, Carver Mead New Adventures Fund, R. David Middlebrook Fellowship, <a href="https://ece.gatech.edu/news/2023/12/gurses-receives-tau-beta-pi-fellowship">Tau Beta Pi Fellowship</a>, <a href="https://ece.gatech.edu/news/2023/12/gurses-tapped-ieee-mtt-s-scholarship">IEEE MTT-S Undergraduate/Pre-Graduate Scholarship</a>, <a href="https://home.cern/news/news/cern/eucys-prizewinner-visits-cern">European Union Contest for Young Scientists CERN Special Donated Prize</a> and <a href="https://www.milliyet.com.tr/yerel-haberler/ankara/yapay-yercekimi-tubitakta-odul-getirdi-10815786">First Prize in Physics in the Turkish National Secondary School Research Contest</a>.
