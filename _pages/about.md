I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Physics at Caltech working broadly on integrated systems. I am especially interested in studying the scaling laws in technologies, discovering their fundamental physical limits and pushing these limits by breaking assumptions. I strongly believe that paradigm shifts in technologies stem from end-to-end knowledge transfer between fundamental science and engineering, necessitating interdisciplinary research.

<b>Research</b>: My PhD research focused on developing large-scale integrated photonic-electronic systems for applications in communications, sensing and computing. I invented various technologies that employ quantum information to achieve superior performance over classical technologies. These include quantum phased arrays, which generalize the operating principles of antenna arrays to quantum fields; quantum-enhanced coherent transceivers that utilize non-classical light to achieve higher sensitivity and channel capacity in links.

<b>Previously</b>: I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering at Georgia Institute of Technology, where I worked with Professors Hua Wang, Morris Cohen, Gregory Durgin and Lukas Graber.
